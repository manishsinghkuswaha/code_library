//Space Complexity : O(1)

//Approach : We find the position(index) of 1(if any) in the first row. Now keeping in mind that the rows are sorted, we iterate over the next rows and 
//           if we found that in the next row there exists a one to the left of the index previously calculated we update our max_row_index and we 
//           continue for the rest of the rows if we can find a 1 whose position is even left of the previous row's 1. This ultimately boils down the 
//           fact that more left the one exits more will be the number of 1s in that row and that row will be our answer. Be careful with the corner cases.
